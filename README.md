# FabCar Blockchain Sample

>Hyperledger Fabric sample Fabcar on IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0

This code pattern demonstrates setting up a network on the IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 and deploying the Fabcar smart contract on the network.  Next, we setup our application to interact with the network including identities to submit transactions on the smart contract.  The application is setup with a Node.js server using the Fabric Node SDK to process requests to the network, and a Vue.js client to bring up a web interface.

 When the reader has completed this code pattern, they will understand how to:

* Setup a Hyperledger Fabric network on IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0
* Install and instantiate smart contract through the IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0
* Develop a Node.js server with the Hyperledger Fabric SDK to interact with the deployed network
* Create a Vue.js frontend for the web app to interface with the network


# Architecture flow

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-images/arch-flow.png">
</p>

The developer uses the IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for VS Code to:

1. The Blockchain Operator sets up the IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 service
2. The IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 enables to create a Hyperledger Fabric network onto a IBM Kubernetes Service, allowing to install and instantiate the Fabcar smart contract on the network
3. The Node.js application server uses the Fabic sdk to interact with the deployed network on IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 and creates APIs for a web client
4. The Vue.js client uses the Node.js application API to interact with the network
5. The User interacts with the Fabcar Vue.js web interface to update and query the blockchain ledger and state

## Running the application

Follow these steps to set up and run this code pattern. The steps are described in detail below.

### Prerequisites

- [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration/?target=%2Fdashboard%2Fapps)
- [Node v8.x or greater and npm v5.x or greater](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [VSCode version 1.26 or greater](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBMBlockchain.ibm-blockchain-platform)
- [Yeoman (yo) v2.x](http://yeoman.io/)

### Steps

> To run a local network, you can find steps [here](./docs/run-local.md)

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Package the smart contract](#2-package-the-smart-contract)
3. [Create IBM Cloud services](#3-create-ibm-cloud-services)
4. [Build a network](#4-build-a-network)
5. [Deploy FabCar Smart Contract on the network](#5-deploy-fabcar-smart-contract-on-the-network)
6. [Connect application to the network](#6-connect-application-to-the-network)
7. [Run the application](#7-run-the-application)


## 1. Clone the repo

Clone this repository in a folder your choice:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/fabcar-blockchain-sample.git
cd fabcar-blockchain-sample
```

## 2. Package the smart contract

We will use the IBM Blockchain Platform extension to package the Fabcar smart contract.
* Open Visual Studio code and open the `contract` folder from this repository that was cloned earlier.

* Press the `F1` key to see the different VS code options. Choose `IBM Blockchain Platform: Package a Smart Contract Project`.

* Click the `IBM Blockchain Platform` extension button on the left. This will show the packaged contracts on top and the blockchain connections on the bottom.

* Next, right click on the packaged contract to export it and choose `Export Package`

* Choose a location on your machine and save `.cds` file.  We will use this packages smart contract later to deploy on our work.

</p>

Now, we will start creating our Hyperledger Fabric network on the IBM Cloud.

## 3. Create IBM Cloud services

* Create the [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/infrastructure/containers-kubernetes).  You can find the service in the `Catalog`.  For this code pattern, we can use the `Free` cluster, and give it a name.  Note, that the IBM Cloud allows one instance of a free cluster and expires after 30 days.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/create-ibm-kubernetes-service.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Create the [IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/infrastructure/containers-kubernetes) service on the IBM Cloud.  You can find the service in the `Catalog`, and give a name.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/create-ibm-blockchain-2-service.gif">
</p>
<br>

* After your kubernetes cluster is up and running, you can deploy your IBM Blockchain Platform on the cluster.  The service walks through few steps and finds your cluster on the IBM Cloud to deploy the service on.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/deploy-blockchain-on-cluster.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Once the Blockchain Platform is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster, you can launch the console to start operating on your blockchain network.

<br>

## 4. Build a network

We will build a network as provided by the IBM Blockchain Platform [documentation](https://console.test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/blockchain/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-network#ibp-console-build-network).  This will include creating a channel with a single peer organization with its own MSP and CA (Certificate Authority), and an orderer organization with its own MSP and CA. We will create the respective identities to deploy peers and operate nodes.

### Create your organization and your entry point to your blockchain

* #### Create your peer organization CA
  - Click <b>Add Certificate Authority</b>
  - Click <b>IBM Cloud</b> under <b>Create Certificate Authority</b> and <b>Next</b>
  - Give it a <b>Display name</b> of `Org1 CA`.  
  - Specify an <b>Admin ID</b> of `admin` and <b>Admin Secret</b> of `adminpw`

<br>
<p align="center">

</p>
<br>


* #### Use your CA to register identities
  - Select the <b>Org 1 CA</b> Certificate Authority that we created
  - First, we will register an admin for our organization "org1". Click on the <b>Register User</b> button.  Give an <b>Enroll ID</b> of `org1admin`, and <b>Enroll Secret</b> of `org1adminpw`.  Click <b>Next</b>.  Set the <b>Type</b>for this identity as `client` and select from any of the affiliated organizations from the drop-down list. We will leave the <b>Maximum enrollments</b> and <b>Add Attributes</b> fields blank
  - We will repeat the process to create an identity of the peer. Click on the <b>Register User</b> button.  Give an <b>Enroll ID</b> of `peer1`, and <b>Enroll Secret</b> of `peer1pw`.  Click <b>Next</b>.  Set the <b>Type</b>for this identity as `peer` and select from any of the affiliated organizations from the drop-down list.
